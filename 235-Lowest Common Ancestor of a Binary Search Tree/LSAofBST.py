'''
Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of
two given nodes in the BST.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia:
“The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest
node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a
descendant of itself).”

Constraints:
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 10^5].
-10^9 <= Node.val <= 10^9
All Node.val are unique.
p != q
p and q will exist in the BST.
